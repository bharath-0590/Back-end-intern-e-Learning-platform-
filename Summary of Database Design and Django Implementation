To design a database for user registration, profiles, courses, and enrollments, we create four tables: User, Profile, Course, and Enrollment. Each table has a primary key and relevant foreign key relationships to ensure data integrity. SQL INSERT statements are used to add sample data to these tables. In a Django application, models are defined to represent these tables, and the Django ORM is used to create and link records programmatically. This setup facilitates user management and course enrollments in a web application, leveraging Django's robust framework for database interactions and web development.
